<h1>THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN TENDENCIES IN MODERN OPERA.</h1>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In this thesis there has been an attempt made to trace the
origin, growth and development, and modification of various tendencies
in the Opera. The form only of the opera has been considered
and no attempt has been made towards the harmonic analysis of the
various operas. The main tendencies that have been discussed are,
the differences in regard to; (1) the number of acts employed;
(2) the number and kind of characters; (3) a comparison; (a) of
the proportion of orchestral work, overtures, ballets and ritornelli;
(b) of solo work and the various voices employed; (c) of
recitative, spoken, accompanied and unaccompanied; (d) of ensemble
work, duets, trios, quartets, quintets and sextets; and
(e) separate from this last, a consideration of the proportion
of chorus work, mixed, and that sung by the men and the women alone.</p>

<p>A study has been made of thirty-four operas and in order
to accurately consider these proportions, tables have been prepared,
showing the percentage of the factors portrayed. These
percentages have been obtained by actual count of the measures
devoted to the solos, choruses, ensembles, etc. There are seven
tables.</p>

<p>Table I is a general table showing the number of characters,
acts, percentage of orchestra, solo, recitative, ensemble
and chorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Table II shows the distribution and number of characters.</p>

<p>Table III shows the percentage of orchestral work, and also
that of the divisions of the orchestral work into overture,
ballet and ritornelli.</p>

<p>Table IV shows the percentage of solo work and its distribution
to the various voices.</p>

<p>Table V shows the percentage of recitative and its distribution
to the various voices.</p>

<p>Table VI shows the percentage of ensemble work and the
various kinds.</p>

<p>Table VII shows the percentage of the chorus work and its
distribution as to mixed choruses and those sung by the men and
women alone.</p>

<p>"Rappresentatione de Anima" by Cavalieri is generally
classed as an oratorio but many authorities consider it an opera,
as he was one of Peri's contemporaries, and worked with the little
band of Florentine nobles, and this was the first work which resulted
from their meetings. However, whether it is an opera or
an oratorio, the forms in those days were very vague, hence, the
component factors are interesting as compared to the later operas,
and inasmuch as no score could be obtained earlier than 1675, it
will suffice as a type of that time. In studying the operas from
Wagner on, the solos have been very difficult to distinguish from
the recitative, and consequently any stretch of solo singing over
twenty or twenty-five measures in length, with any sort of tune,
has been considered as a solo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="I_THE_BEGINNINGS_OF_OPERA_TO_GLUCK">I. THE BEGINNINGS OF OPERA TO GLUCK.</h2>

<p>Before beginning the survey of modern operas and before
tracing the development of the different tendencies, it will be
interesting to consider briefly the historic source of the opera,
and the part that music played in the various dramas, madrigals,
ballets, church services, etc.</p>

<p>It is an acknowledged fact that Peri and his little band
of Florentine reformers went back to the old Greek dramas for
their models and forms. However, it is not to be supposed that
opera was developed spontaneously among these reformers. Like
every other world wide movement, it was the culmination of tendencies
and customs from various sources. We have no reason to accept
the Greek dramas as the only models which served, although they
were considered seriously by the first opera writers.</p>

<p>The Egyptians sang jubilations to their Gods. These consisted
of florid cadences on prolonged vowel sounds. In the old
Greek dramas, music played an important part. The Greek tragedy
and comedy developed from the hymns, choral dances and chants
sung by a chorus of singers disguised as satyrs, at the festivals
of Bacchus. The chorus often addressed the audience on topical
subjects. The various actors intoned or chanted their words, and
were often accompanied by a lyre and other instruments of the day.
The chorus chanted their parts. This would not be termed music
by us today, but was more of a recitative. Later the chorus chanted
while the principals sang, forming a sort of background accompaniment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
The slow developement of the music in the mass must not be
forgotten, but there is nothing which definitely resembles opera
until the thirteenth century. "Noel" was supposed to be a song
which the angels sang, and is found in many festivals. Perhaps this
may be termed one of the sources of Wagner's ideas, the association
of a particular song with one group of people. In the "Three
Maries" the chorus sang words in Latin, Gabriel and the three virgins
sang, but the words of the Savior had no music. The "Fete of
the Ass" was quite an elaborate festival and here the various
characters sang quite definitely, and the congregation was urged
at stated intervals to join in the singing. Part of the words and
music were symbolical, especially those imitating the braying of
the ass. "The Passion", in 1264, enacted by the Fraternity of the
Gonfalone, lasted for several days, and contained scenes which
were sung, choruses and a trio.</p>

<p>At this period, we must consider the vaudeville plays
which were plays interspersed with song. "Li gieus de Robin et
de Marion", given at the court of Charles d'Artois in Naples in
1285, was an operatic symptom and was divided into songs, spoken
dialogue, dialogue songs in which two voices alternated, and popular
ballad tunes, although the music was not appropriate since it
consisted of such complex counterpoint. The Madrigal plays, although
comic in character, influenced in the introduction of
village gossip related by chorus. The "Ballet de la Reine" was a
brilliant ballet with elaborate scenery, costumes, music, etc.
It contained solos, duets, choruses and instrumental interludes.
The melody, however, was only loosely associated with the play.
In 1554 "Il Sagrifigio", a pastoral drama, arose, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
priest sang solos, accompanied by lyre and the chorus. The first
solo singing was in the Madrigal of Corteccia in 1539. In "Aminta",
1573, the choruses separated acts, and introduced the action
danced to the chorus behind the scenes. There was no attempt at
the complete setting of the text in these plays, and no union of
the lyrics by any sort of recitative. In "Decameron" one or another
of the personages sang to the company, and they all sang and danced.
The lyric solo resembled somewhat the dramatic recitative of Peri
and Caccini. The vocal melody was simple in melodic structure.
Cecchi's "Esaltazione delle Croce", 1589, a sacred representation,
had an orchestra of viols, lutes, horns and the orchestra played
an interlude with special music. There was an accompanied solo
allotted to the Deity and a dance of David. The orchestras were
composed of lutes, trombones, which accomapnied the dancing, etc.,
but were usually silent after the entrance of the various characters,
excepting the lyres. In the English masque the words and
song were written for an actor but sung behind the scenes by a
chorus.</p>

<p>The Madrigal dramas became comedies which exhibited a
variety of style and expressive power. When a single character
spoke, the chorus sang in madrigals, while the actors were on the
stage. The music was from behind the curtain. These Madrigal dramas
began to degenerate, however, as the spectacle disappeared, and
the comic element became preeminent.</p>

<p>Then came the band of Florentine nobles who were not originators,
but merely revived certain musical practices and traditions
of the 14th century and modeled these on the early Greek
tragedies. "Eurydice" was accompanied by a large orchestra for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
those days consisting of a chitarone, viola di gamba, theorba,
three flutes and smaller trombones. There was a brief entr'acte,
and a trio of two sopranos and a tenor. The chorus was in five
parts. Previous to this the solo without harmony or harmonic
support was unknown. The instrumental music was of course in its
infancy and expressive melody was out of the question. This first
operatic orchestra was concealed&mdash;perhaps this suggested the idea
to Wagner&mdash;perhaps not. There were no set tunes, nor any sort of
formal melody divided into periods, balancing each other symmetrically,
but a sort of recitative which observed the inflection of
the spoken words was created.</p>

<p>Peri developed this principle to a great extent. He expressed
soft gentle speech by half spoken, half sung tones on a
sustained instrumental bass. Feelings of deeper emotional kind,
he expressed by melody with greater intervals and a lively tempo,
accompanied by instrumental harmonies changing frequently, sometimes
using dissonance. His prologue was in verse and he gave
short metrical passages for the chorus which were rich in harmony.
An instrumental episode in the first act and dancing in
the end are effective.</p>

<p>Vecchi's "L'Amfiparnasso" and "Commedia Armonica" are
really only a series of madrigals for five voices. There was no
overture, no orchestral accompaniment, nor ritornello of any
kind. When the stage was occupied by a single character, four
voices were made to sing behind the scenes, foretelling the modern
orchestra. In "Orfeo" the accompaniment was a figured bass.
"Dafne" and "Arianna" were written in this newly invented "Stilo
rappresentatino" with a larger orchestra. "Dafne" consisted of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
imitation of speech, a sort of melodious recitative accompanied
only with a sustained bass. The instruments were really so contrasted
and combined as to invest each character and scene with
marked individuality. The introductory toccata (founded on a single
chord) was followed by a ritornello, the recitative was accompanied
by a figured bass, sometimes by two or more instruments
indicated at the beginning.</p>

<p>These reformers really resuscitated a style of musical
declamation, and their music better expressed passion and the
like. There was a monodic exchanging of contrapuntal richness for
the simplest of melodies, confined to a single part, and accompanied
by bass of the rudest type and construction. The melodies
were destitute of figure and the composers really aimed at exact
oratorical rendering of the words. The possibilities of orchestral
coloring were limited and the dry style of recitative really
dramatically untruthful. There was little variety of contrast.
This weakened the true power of the drama by the introduction
of measured melody and formally constructed movements. The libbrettos
were carefully considered at first, but finally declined,
and more and more attention was paid to the aria and the various
concerted music introduced without regard to the dramatic tendencies.
The rules became strict, and it is not difficult to see how
the operas became a concert in costume. We find a quotation of
the rules:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A woman always took a man's part.</p>

<p>2. Characters were stereotyped.</p>

<p>3. Position of the aria was determined to give entrance impressiveness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The solos, duets, choruses and ballets were arranged artificially
to suit the convenience of the performers and without
regard for the dramatic context.</p>

<p>Monteverde has been termed "the Italian Wagner". He never
ventured to introduce flowing melody save in the ritornello. His
music was dramatic and he increased the dramatic scope of the recitative.
His "Orfeo", 1607, contains the first dramatic duet.
He was an innovator and gave a new developement to the harmonic
system. His influence may be summed up as follows;</p>

<p>I. He made operatic recitative more melodious and expressive.</p>

<p>II. He boldly used unprepared discord to express dramatic
emotions.</p>

<p>III. He greatly enlarged the orchestra, used special, appropriate
groups of instruments to accompany characters, and employed
separate combinations to announce the return and entry of persons.
In his "Arianna" the widening influence of his orchestra developed
to thirty-six instruments, including violins, trombones, trumpets
and three small organs. He invented the pizzicato and tremolo on
the violin. In his "Orfeo" there are parts for the harpsichords,
lyres, violas, double basses, double harps with two rows of strings,
two violins, guitars, organs, flutes, clarions and trombones. The
apportionment of the instruments was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The bass viols accompanied Orpheus.</p>

<p>The violas, Eurydice.</p>

<p>Four Trombones, Pluto.</p>

<p>The organs, Apollo.</p>

<p>The guitars, Charon.</p>

<p>The flute registers of the organs, the chorus of sprites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarlatti's genius for melody modified the still though
dramatically correct recitative, and substituted airs in its place.
He introduced measured recitative for the first time, and invented
the "de capo aria", his singers thus distracting attention from
the important dramatic meaning. His knowledge of counterpoint
aided him in the construction of the bass, and elaboration of accompaniments.
He tired of the monotony of uninterrupted recitative,
and organized three forms:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Recitative secco for ordinary business.</p>

<p>2. Recitative stromentato which was accompanied and used
for violent emotion, and used the "thorough bass" by the harpsichord
to aid this passionate form of declamation. The sense of
the verbal text was enforced by continual interposition of orchestral
symphonies.</p>

<p>3. The aria, to which he added the "de capo"&mdash;that is,
the repetition of the second part following the first.</p>

<p>Cavalli employed the ritornello constantly to relieve the
monotony of continuous recitative, and introduced repetition in
his ariettas, which was disapproved by the Florentine Caccini,
who was the father of a new order of music, a style of melody
which is not melody; a recitative melody, noble in character and
surpassing the songs of the people, not altering the words nor
depriving them of life, but augmenting them and giving them
meaning and force.</p>

<p>Purcell had true dramatic instinct and a declamatory recitative
second only to that of Wagner, and his airs show unfettered
melody. The laws of his time, which he chose to disregard
and modify, are interesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>I. The number of characters was six, three women and
three men.</p>

<p>a. Prima Donna (soprano).</p>

<p>b. A contralto.</p>

<p>c. An artificial or male soprano.</p>

<p>d. An artificial alto.</p>

<p>e. A tenor.</p>

<p>f. A bass.</p>

<p>II. (a) "Aria Cantabile" was quiet and slow with opportunities
of ornamentation, accompanied by a figured bass under
pathos.</p>

<p>(b) "Aria di portamento" in slow movement and marked
rythm was sometimes accompanied only by one or two violins.</p>

<p>(c) "Aria di mezzo carattere" had the second part
faster than the first, and the accompaniment was rich and varied.</p>

<p>(d) "Aria Parlante" was elaborately declamatory.</p>

<p>(e) "Aria di bravura" was allegro with brilliant
divisions.</p>

<p>III. There were three acts and every scene terminated
with an air. Every member sang one air but no one sang two airs
in succession and no two airs of the same type followed each other.
The most important ones came at the conclusion of the first and
second act and here the hero and heroine claimed a grand scene,
with accompanied recitative followed by "aria d'agilita" and then
united in a grand duet. The third act ended with a chorus of lively
movement frequently accompanied by a dance. There were no trios,
quartets or other concentrated movements allowed, though three
characters could join in harmonized exclamation at close of the
recitative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Handel broke away from these rules in "Radamisto" with
an elaborate quartet and "Teseo" in five acts with two airs in
succession to each character. His operas have been termed a ballad
concert in costume, although he did a great deal toward faithful
reproduction of the embodied sentiments of the text. Purcell rebelled
against the idea of succession of songs and dances and in a
tuneful chorus with dramatic spoken action, he introduced a decided
dramatic feeling. The English opera was advertised to be performed
after the Italian manner, with recitative in place of dialogue
and measured melody for airs. Purcell's "Dido and Aeneus"
contains not one spoken word, and his drawn out aria foreshadowed
the dramatic aria of Gluck and Wagner. Balfe and Benedict raised
the standard of the old ballad operas by using better music although
Balfe only appealed to the ear. Tallis, Byrde and Purcell
are tolerated for their voice parts only.</p>

<p>"In the early 18th century the condition of opera was
very 'low'". The accepted number of characters was six, three of
each sex. There were three acts of a given number of verses based
on Greek drama. The chorus stood motionless except for the leader,
in a double row with the sexes separated and masked. The same libretti
were used time and time again. The poets became as stilted
as the composers. There were five types of melody whose sequence
and distribution were regulated by rules, and not by dramatic requirements.
Though varied in other ways, the songs consisted of
two parts, the first repeated "de capo" after the second, notwithstanding
the histronic result. The vocalist tyrannized over
the performance, displaying no musical feeling, nothing but vocal
agility. In England and Germany the singers sang their own language
during the performance, for every thing except the formal arias,
which were sung in Italian. Each act had to close with an elaborate
finale, and each singer had to have an aria.</p>

<p>Sammartini in Milan gave prominence to string quartets.
There was much stress laid on technical proficiency and arias.
The dances became better than the vocal music, for the arias
especially were monotonous and forced, and overloaded with ornament
and contained practically no counterpoint. The overture,
customarily in three parts, was separated from the opera itself.
The arias were in bravura style with long and prolix ritornelli.
The dramatic airs were absolutely spoiled by florishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Gluck freed the opera from many of these forms. He maintained
that the function of the music was to support the poetry
without interrupting action or disfiguring by superfluous ornament.
The dramatic action was given more importance and the concerted
pieces with stereotyped de capo were discarded. He was
criticized for sacrificing music to drama, which would often
have been better without it. This has also been said of Debussy's
"Pelleas and Melisande." Gluck colored his music and avoided
interrupting the actor in the warmth of the dialogue to wait for
ritornello, flourishes and repetitions. He maintained that the
overture should prepare specifically for the character of action
and indication of the subject. Instruments should be employed
in proportion to the degree of interest and passion. Above all
he worked for simplicity; that opera must express life in aria
and in recitative, and in similarity between the passion and the
object called forth. His melody was supported by harmony and
was varied in rythm. He strove for pictorial representation in
his airs and accompanied his recitatives by figured bass and
chords of the harpsichord, and employed several airs preceded
by long instrumental solos. He changed and consolidated the
structure of the opera on the verbal basis, and repressed the vanity
and egotism of the singers. He galvanized the lazy languid
orchestra into life and made the recitative play a more important
part, making his opera dignified, overture elucidatory, accompaniment
significant, and emphasized the coherent principle
of unity.</p>

<p>In "Telemaco" Gluck imitated aspects of nature in several
of the arias with greater unity of handling, truer dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
expression, and continuous interest in the recitative. There are
nine numbers following in dramatic sequence. He abandoned the
symphony in three pieces making his overture lead into the opening
aria. His two themes begin finely in contra-distinction but
they degenerate into bravura style. Gluck studied literature
and filled in the void for recitative so that the audience could-not
play chess in between numbers.</p>

<p>"Orpheus" is lyrical and noticeable for the dramatic interest
of the recitative, and the importance of the work given
to the chorus. His duo-thematic treatment of the orchestra here
is not successful. In his short orchestral prelude he breaks away
from the spirit of the overture. The chorus takes up the
broad sad theme. Orpheus cries, "Eurydice", twice, the third
time he sings a note higher and stands against chords of diminished
intervals, instead of blending with the chord of the minor
third of the dominant, making a striking dramatic effect. The
theme of the aria is echoed behind the scenes. In the accompanied
recitative the orchestra has a share in producing the effect. In
one aria when the sense of the words changes, the whole character
of the music changes. Three fourth time, in the key of G, is used
to depict the happiness of man. Where Cupid relates to Orpheus,
an andante in three eighth time in the key of D is used.</p>

<p>Gluck has too many contrasts of slow and fast to be effective.
His overtures and finales are weak, and he could not
quite effect a compromise between the musical and the dramatic.</p>

<p>He improved the old antagonism between the aria and the
recitative by giving the orchestra the function of adding some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sort of color to the mere vocal padding. He insisted on acting,
instead of mere singing by posturing sopranos and a chorus of
wax figures. He insisted also on his music being sung as written.
His bold stroke was uneven, but such a dramatic genius has never
been surpassed.</p>

<p>In "Alceste" his overture assumed a new significance. It
had no formal end but was broken into by the chorus. In "Armide"
each character had music personally distinctive. "Iphigenie en
Tauride" combined dramatic sincerity, superb use of recitative,
natural and telling though simple choruses, throbbing height of
passion, unification of parts of soloists, chorus and orchestra.
He is termed a "creator of dramatic music". Orchestration was his
specialty although he introduced it subservient to action. However,
Gluck never employed trill passages or cadenzas, for he
wanted to accentuate nature and strengthen declamation. His choruses
are treated as "an additional acting character", and his
recitative is true to the dramatic import. Rameau's and Lulli's
operas were crabbed and rigid in comparison. Gluck alone gives
each personage a style that is proper. The musicians who would
not, or could not sing, except from the wings, were ignored by
Gluck, and he refused the undramatic demands of the manager. In
"Iphigenia en Tauris" the chorus works into a background which
appropriately and dramatically supports the singer. The two tendencies
in Gluck are, to neglect all sensuous aesthetic pleasure
for attainment of dramatic intensity through declamation, and
to realize his purpose through emotional pleasure, harmony of
color, greater unity of scenes, the carrying out of one dramatic
idea from the beginning to the end, making each individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
part stronger.</p>

<p>Piccini was the innovator of the dramatic treatment of
the duet and extended development of the finale. He was the first
to turn choral masses to account on the stage. He used "Recitative
instrumento" in pale of the ordinary "Recitative secco." Mozart
enlarged on his ideas, for his command of the orchestra was
unrivalled as a dramatic factor. Cimarosa placed a statue on the
stage, with a pedestal in the orchestra, while Mozart placed the
staue in the orchestra, using the work of the stage as the pedestal.
Cimarosa uses the accompaniment for the support while
Mozart intensifies the voice. Cimarosa was the first to introduce
quartets and other concerted pieces in the midst of dramatic
action, and not as an ornament at the end of the act, but he
was outdistanced by Mozart. Before this, opera was merely a recitative,
with a chorus at the end of each act, and then occasional
airs were introduced, but not before the middle of the 18th
century do we find trios, etc.</p>

<p>Beethoven and Weber followed Gluck. Beethoven gave to the
orchestra the explanatory character of the chorus. He employs
twenty phrases for a single character in "Fidelio". Weber used
spoken dialogue and recitative sparingly but when neccessary
composed with originality and dramatic vividness. He tried to
construct drama by means of melody and failed. The first example
of a grand orchestral prelude is written in six-fourth time to
"Der Beberrscher der Geister." The overture to "Der Freischutz",
by the use of leading themes, relates the entire story.</p>

<p>In the Italian and French school, "a la Sopontini" the orchestra
lifted and balanced the words and the spirit of the orchestra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
reveals the innermost emotions of the dramatic personae.
The Mythical manner is chosen, and a use of alliterative verse
with a peculiar use of the orchestra as preparing, supporting,
commenting upon, enforcing and recalling the various situations
of the text.</p>

<h2 id="III_ROSSINI_AND_HIS_SCHOOL_UP_TO_WAGNER">III. ROSSINI AND HIS SCHOOL UP TO WAGNER.</h2>

<p>In 1814 the operatic conditions were deplorable. Vocalists
were masters over the composers. They accepted the mere
skeleton of a tune, and so adorned it with their own trills and
flourishes that the poor composer could scarcely recognize it.
The solos were placed to suit their convenience, whether or not
they were suited dramatically. The tenor singers were very prominent
and the bass singers had not as yet emerged from the background.</p>

<p>Rossini expelled the male soprani from the stage, directed
and controlled his own operas. His music was sensuous
and, as shown in "William Tell", of a simple dramatic style.
The operas were of two acts and scarcely conducive to the maintenance
of dramatic action, separated by a ballet. His "Elizabetha"
contained an overture, a duet and the finale had involved
motives in the orchestra. There were two tenors, for the bass was
still in the background. This was the first opera in which the
recitative was accompanied by a stringed quartet and double bass.
He supported the declamation by brilliant themes for the orchestra.
"The Barber of Seville" is a series of melodies, continuous,
and the characters only ceased to sing for strains executed by
the instrumentalists. The transfer of the current of the melody
from the voices to the orchestra was an entirely new idea. He
also introduced new instruments into the orchestra.</p>

<p>Mozart was indebted to the Italians for the sweetness of
his melodies and gave to Italy, through Rossini, new instrumental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
combinations, new dramatic methods and new operatic forms.
The horn, eighty years ago, was not very important in Italy and
the orchestration played in the operatic band probably had a part
in developing the taste for wind instruments and especially for
horns. Rossini was a student of Haydn's symphonies and quartets.</p>

<p>In the opera-buffo "L'Equivaco Stravagante" the concerted
pieces are good, and the final rondo a type of final airs.
"L'Inganno Felice" was the first to make an impression. "Ciro
in Babilonia" was given to accomodate a woman, who sustained one
tone while the orchetra played the melody. With "Tancredi" came
the commencement of reforms and the character of the easily comprehended
melodies was fascinating. Rossini substituted singing
for declamation, for monologues supported by chords, and concerted
pieces connected with and supported by a brilliant orchestral
accompaniment. In "Tancredi" the bass was given prominence, in
fact he was as prominent as the tenor. In "Semiramide" the principal
is a bass. The action is sustained, the number of formal airs
decreased, the number of characters increased and a free use
made of the chorus, which previous to this time had been merely
a subordinate part with no dramatic functions. In "Otello" the
recitative is used more sparingly and accompanied by a full band,
from which the piano was banished. This had been expelled before
in Germany, and by Gluck in France. The two leading parts are assigned
to bass voices, and the interminable recitative accompanied
by double piano or piano and double bass, is done away with.
The most beautiful airs for the prima donna are in "La Cenercatola".</p>

<p>Rossini was now bringing his operas to a brilliant termination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and beginning to emphasize the alto and mezzo voice.
It was only toward the end of his Italian career in "Matilda di
Shubrun" that he assigned the leading part to a soprano. We find
now that there are no leading parts written for contralto and
whether this is due the fact that the soprano has bean forced into
activity to suit new tastes, or because contraltos are rare,
we can not say. Of course Meyerbeer's "L'Africaine" and Donnizetti's
"La Favorita" are exceptions. The orchestration of "La
Gazza Ladrone" is more brilliant and sonorous than that of its
predecessors and introduces new instruments, new combinations,
a new distribution of voice parts, and of orchestral melodies
with declamatory phrases for the singers instead of the endless
recitative accompanied only by chords for the cellos or piano.</p>

<p>He introduced cornets and ophicleides in the overture to
"William Tell", as the nearest approach to the actual instruments
used by the cowherders of Switzerland. In "Semiramide" he
brought an entire band onto the stage and wrote beautifully harmonized
music which suggests the chase. He began the overture
to "La Gazza Ladrona" with a duet for the drums, and did away with
the extemporaneous attempts at orchestration by solo instrumentalists
in the accompaniment, who were every bit as disagreeable
and authoritative os the vocal soloists.</p>

<p>Berlioz charged that Rossini's music was heartless, unemotional
and written entirely for the singer, utterly disregarding
the vocal effect. His particular attention to orchestral and choral
effects may be traced to the Parisian influence of his fine
experience in hearing their choruses and orchestras. His music
changed from the soft voluptuous melodies of "Semiramide" to simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
emotional dramatic ones in "William Tell".</p>

<p>Rossini, as mentioned before, was the first Italian to accompany
recitative with a full band, assign leading parts to the
bass, make each dramatic scene one continuous piece of music, and
bring to perfection the highly varied, amply developed, concerted
finales.</p>

<p>Donizetti wrote from sixty to seventy operas, but his
"Don Pasquale" is in a light style as compared to the "Barber of
Seville" and does not approach "Semeramide" for melody, nor "William
Tell" for dramatic value. Stendhal foretold that the florid
music of Rossini would be followed by a master of simple melodies
and we find Bellini to be the one. Donizetti's work is not well
balanced and he sways from one extreme to the other. His tenor
air in "Anne Bolena" is attractive for it possesses more dramatic
significance than most of his. He counted on the pure musical effect,
which is naturally more effective in spoken drama than in
opera, which is sung through out. For instance, the horn of "Hermani"
is terrifying when heard in the play, but merely ordinary
when heard in the opera. He seldom wrote a tune, or scored a half
dozen measures of simple accompaniment, without burying the voice
under ponderous chords for the wood winds. "Lucrezia Borgia" contains
less recitative than was customary with Rossini. Notice
must be taken of the brilliancy of the introduction, the series
of dramatic scenes and the large number of tuneful themes distributed
judiciously for the four leading personages. "Lucia" is
broadly conceived, well constructed and highly dramatic, especially
where the chorus informs Lucia of the end of Edgar. In "La
Favorita" there is passionate impulsiveness in the final duet, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
choruses are impressive, and the music appropriate to the various
personages and situations of the piece.</p>

<p>Bellini had true melody and his creative power was more
effective than Donizetti's, as was his use of the orchestra. He abandoned
trills and for ornamentation delivered simple phrases. "La
Somnambula" is an endless flow of melodies full of true emotion and
thoroughly dramatic, for he gave attention to the orchestration
and concerted melodies. Rossini emphasized the necessity of introducing
choruses, which he maintained were indispensable for dramatic
effect, and we find his ideas developed by these men. However,
these, and Paisiello's form of long scenes of recitative are old
now.</p>

<p>Mozart's introduction to "Figaro" first introduces the
air by the orchestra, then transcribed for the solo voice and finally
sung by the chorus. The melody of his "Zitti Zitti" trio was take I
from Hayden's "Seasons". He has adapted also an air from a Russian
dance to aid in the dramatic effect. He reached the highest perfection
of expression of melody with the strings, woodwinds and
voice. His librettos are weak, however, although he rewrote the
less important ones himself. His recitative is barren, for in his operas
one had only to sing beautifully, while in Wagner one must declaim
beautifully. Mozart knew music as the art of expression and
gave this in its fullest sense to airs, duets and ensemble pieces,
yet he left opera forms as he found them. He spoke of and depicted
scenes, animals, etc. in his music. "Magic Flute" is a primma donna
opera. Mozart considered first music, then the book and lastly the
performance. In "Figaro" the psychological handling of the characters
is unconvincing. He has applied one invariable musical formula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to every character. He repeats one or two chords ad infinitum in
the orchestra. The voice trips along on top of these in semi speed.
He sanctioned formulas for cadences used in every situation. Even
in "Don Giovanni" the formulas for the cadences are used in this
manner. He uses the same method for light scenes as well as tragic
situations, depicting indignant heroines and chorus in the same
manner. He was more musical but he did not realize the dramatic situations.</p>

<p>Bellini was a pure melodist, but his instrumentation was
faulty, and he objected to ornamentation.</p>

<p>The French opera helps to develop the tendency of individual
expression while the German crushes it in striving for a
whole general effect. Rameau's "Hyppolyte et Aricie" is the most
highly developed study of character. Lulli's work is an amplification
of Ramean's work. He combined simplicity, natural melody and
dramatic intentions. He developed his attention to the orchestra,
and employed the chorus as an integral factor in the situation.
He invented the overture using a slow movement, followed by a quick
fugal style with the third division, a short dance. He developed
the style of the French ballet. Both he and Ramean considered accompanied
recitative a matter of more importance than a continuous
flow of melodies. He reduced music to a minimum in this and did
not dominate it in time, rythm nor musical feeling. He characterized
it by accentuating the metrical and prosodial elements of the
words themselves, and followed closely the accent of the words,
changing rapidly from four-four rythm to three-four, and back again.</p>

<p>There is no feeling in his arias for he was restricted to
conventional forms, and his melodies are characterless. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
"Comique de la Rayne", arranged by Baltazan de Beaujoyeaux, with
dance, tunes, chorus, musical dialogues and ritornelli he exhibits
a bold and highly cultivated taste for instrumental music
which led him to mold the overture into a more perfect form.</p>

<p>The serious opera, however, was becoming a mass of absurdities,
emphasizing the spectacle as superior to the music, with
bad libretti, degenerating under aristocratic patronage. The overture
was to anticipate the opera and a better recitative was wanted.
Gluck wished to minimize the disparity between opera and recitative
and protested against the frequent use of the de capo and repetition
of words, maintaining that the words should only be repeated where
required by circumstances of passion.</p>

<p>Meyerbeer was feeble in harmonic invention with no psychological
grip but with a talent for manipulating broad contrasts
and climaxes of sound. He is a creator of modern stage technique,
merging scenes and music into unity, a school of dramatic effects
closely studied by Berlioz and Wagner.</p>

<p>Bizet's "Carmen" is the most brilliant and best to convey
the romance of the nomadic desire in the gypsy. The ballets and operas
of Delibes are like the fashioning of a piece of Sevres china.
Cesar Franck's veil of harmonies envelops a multitude of themes
so that the tragic ending almost gives one a sense of peace. Auber
was the last to represent the Opera Comique and is noted for his
simple melodies, and the rythm and brilliancy of his orchestral
effects. Bizet's operas are notable for their abundance of local
color, but Meyerbeer was the most influential except Wagner. He
opened up a new epoch in French opera.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="IV_WAGNER">IV. WAGNER.</h2>

<p>Wagner objected to the sentimental Italian music. He considered
Gluck only a musician of airs, and himself insisted on absolute
equality of words and music. His "Trilogy" is the longest
musical work in the world, containing 984,033 notes. He discarded
formal arias, finales, separate movements, to a great extent choruses,
whereever histrionic delineation did not demand them. He considered
a full close or final cadence quaint and for usual formal
melodies substituted declamatory recitative or speech song.</p>

<p>Gluck and Wagner brought back undying principles of dramatic
worth. In the days of Bellini, Rossini and Donizetti, melody
was supreme. The dramatic truth was lost sight of and the melody
was not appropriate. In "William Tell" and "Der Freischutz" there
was a step onwards towards the Wagner reform and a return to the
first principles of dramatic art as applied to opera by the Bardi
coterie. There was recitative, declamation and melody. Individualism
was the prevailing tendency, and the success depends on the forcibleness
of character development by means of the leitmotiv. Operatic
art was here swaying between Wagnerism and the ancient Greek drama.
This union of drama and music does away with the old absurd Italian
form, in which the libretto was a mere skeleton, the situations unnatural
and the music inappropriate and undramatic.</p>

<p>The Wagner texts were better and abolished concerted music
which was unnatural, and he demanded distinctness in ennunciation,
musical embodiment of emotional speech, melodic independence
of the orchestra and rapid and natural action. The Italian libretto
was merely an excuse for musical adornment, but the Wagnerian opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was a source of inspiration. Wagner translated every character,
emotion, dramatic action, symbolic idea by a series of characteristic
phrases. He joined motive to motive, developed with artistic
skill a musical current rolling along in the orchestral accompaniment
and ample in every word.</p>

<p>In his earlier works Wagner adhered to the lyrical conception
of the opera. Speech was raised by stress of emotion into song
with the orchestra used only as an accompaniment and, under this new
system, effected an organization of instrumental and vocal forces.
In "Das Rheingold" the orchestra is exalted to symphonic dignity
with the traditional alternations of the formal song and recitative
merged into free declamation. The symphonic treatment of the orchestra
led to increased developmentt of leading motives. As symphonic
music presupposes the use of musical themes, Wagner drew
his themes not from the words sung by the characters but from the
characters themselves, their thoughts, feelings and aspirations.
In the love duet in "Die Walküre" the most delicious harmony is expressed.</p>

<p>Wagner was both a poet and a musician and combined poetry,
music and pantomine painting. He is called the "reformer of opera",
a "regenerator of modern drama". Wagner's great work aside
from the leitmotiv was his work with recitative. Up to this time
the recitative and the arias were dry, weak, barren and hampered
every composer and poet. Up to his time the recitative aria and the
ballet had undergone no organic change, though the aria had suffered
many changes of fashion. He did not mean to sacrifice the
beauty of sound in the Italian operas, but this had so far usurped
the first place, while the dramatic motive which had inspired the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
invention of the opera. His works are not conspicuous for pure melody,
for he considered the dramatic effect of chords and discords.
He paid deference to the language employed and the vocal peculiarities
of the people, for the German words were unintelligible when
sung to the florid Italian tunes. He wrote the vocal parts of his
lyric dramas to bring out the force of his poetry.</p>

<p>He gave new expression to new ideas. Peri, in "Eurydice",
concealed an orchestra behind the scenes. In Monteverde's "Orfeo",
thirty-six different instruments were relegated to each personage.
Wagner assigned an instrument or set of instruments to each person.
His typical phrases are most interesting. He pictures the giants,
in "Das Rheingold", with loud heavy octaves, the Nibelung, tricksters
and schemers, with music of a descending figure, twothirds
the interval of a seventh, the melodies of the Rhine with characteristic
figures depicting slow undulation of water in its depths,
flux and reflux of element, ripples on the surface and the motion
of the swimmers.</p>

<p>His "Rheingold" music is truly scenic. It begins with a
single deep tone and then introduces instruments of a lighter color.
The graduated augmentation of the wavy accompaniment and the doubly
delineative spirit reflects the sinless quiet of the Golden Age.
There are themes for mental states and the evil Alberich is represented
by abrupt jerky music. The orchestra discourses mournfully
of the renunciation of love. Loga is depicted by fitful chromatic
phrases which crackle and flash thru the orchestra. The sword
phrase consists of major harmonies over sustained pedal point, and
the thunderstorm of rushing figures in bass, and staccato lightning
in short rapid figures in lighter instruments, crashing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
wind in chromatic phrases, a hammering rythm for the Nibelung.
Siegfried's boyhood is pictured as a wild forest lad with a hunting
call, and when he gathers pieces of the spear the music accompaniment
is in broken rythm.</p>

<p>In "Parsifal" the music depicts little of external things.
In "Tannhaüser" there are fancies which Wagner wished to float thru
the minds of the audience and the Pilgrim's Chant swells and disappears.
In "Tristan and Isolde" the prelude represents the spiritual
progress of the tragedy. The suffering of the wounded Tristan
is shown by a theme of descending half steps and a closing cadence
of short phrases which stand for the love glance is a downward
leap of the seventh. The symbol of death is expressed with a sudden
and unprepared change from A flat to A. The music consists of a
few phrases which unfold themselves over and over again in a variety
of combinations with continually changing instrumental color.
"Die Meistersinger" prelude delineates the characteristic traits
of the personages, and the symphonic introduction indicates the
elements of the plot, the progress in its developement and the outcome.
The two classes of melodies are broadly distinguished in external
physiognomy and emotional essence, at first consecutively,
then in conflict and finally in harmonious and contented union.
The solid old burghers of Nuremburg, a little vain, are pictured
by strong simple tunes with sequences of the intervals of the simple
diatonic scale, strongly and simply harmonized, a trifle pompous
in opposition to the passion of the lovers displayed. These
themes differ in every respect, melodic, rythmic, and harmonic, and
also in their treatment. The lover's theme is chromatic, the rythme
are less regular and more eager by syncopation. This is harmonized
with greater warmth and set for the instruments with greater passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Wagner's orchestra acquired gradually the functions of the
Greek chorus, in that it takes part in the action to publish that
which is beyond the capacity of the personages alone to utter. He
unfolds thoughts, emotions, motives and passions by means of mode,
harmony, rythm, time and the orchestration. By applying the principles
of augmentation to a phrase in the three phases of melodic,
harmonic and instrumental structure, he illustrates the tragic
growth of Siegfried. He wrote his own librettos so that his works
would be consistent. "Tristan and Isolde", "Die Meistersinger", "Der
Ring des Nibelunger" and "Parsifal" realized his conception of
what a poet composer should be. Music had usurped the place in
lyric drama and music is a medium only and not an end of dramatic
expression. His leitmotiv, infinite melody and symbolical themes
gave his orchestra color. He used musical declamation for recitative
secco, employed choruses with intelligent regard, and originated
arias from the situations. Wagner lived for pure singing
and did not make abnormal demands upon the voice like those of
Strauss' "Electra". He has long solo passages and orderly development
of orchestral themes, as different from Debussy whose
sounds are not connected. Wagner elevated the orchestra from a
mere accompanying force to an essential factor. He maintained that
formal song should be abolished, that the dialogue should be musical
and that the orchestra should have an orderly development
of melodic material save when the climaxes justify an apparently
disconnected dramatic melodramatic method. Damrosch criticizes
Wagner because he says everything in his orchestra, and his singer
is too little considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>However, his operas are a tableaux of gorgeous glowing
pictures, and he has had no successful imitation. His scheme of
thematic identification and development in its union of calculation
and reflection and musical inspiration, is beyond the capacities
of those who have come after him. Musical critics and historians
have been occupied with the question as to whether or not the progress
in operatic composition is possible on the lines laid down, although
his influence is a modification of the old method rather
than the invention of new ideas. We look to the theatres of Paris
for his influence in corrections and technical finish. The clear
musical phrases of the "Flying Dutchman" are presented in symphonic
way and there is an introduction, aria, scene, duet and chorus. The
commencement of each of the three acts with a chorus was a mannerism,
but Wagner scarcely ever employed it. In "Tannhauser" there is
only one duet. He advanced individualism of the dramatic mood by
banishing the aria. He made the orchetra the chief sustainer of the
musical framework with the voice for the dramatic organ. The lyric
recitative is reechoed at times by melodic phrases and developed
motives. The extreme limit of Wagner's methods is "Salome", which
is really a symphonic poem for a gigantic orchestra to the accompaniment
of dramatic action with a voice obligato.</p>

<p>Gounod did not use prolonged themes unless for a dramatic
or purely ethical reason. "Faust" is the best suited for the human
voice. The orchestra never submerges the voice and is only a factor
and not a sum total. At this time the Italian school was at the
height where flimsy librettos only served to string together duets,
quartets or choruses. In "Faust" there is the first artistic union
of score and words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Verdi had a keen dramatic vision and assigned greater
importance to the orchestra than his Italian predecessors. There
is an absence, for the most part, of set airs, and there is a continuity
of musical structure. The orchestration is wonderful, but
the voice still remains the centre of the musical system. The style
is more that of Donizetti's than Bellini's, although critics declare
the music of "Ernani" noisy and commonplace, with too much
brass in the orchestra. His chorus was written in unison, and passed
too abruptly from one piece to another, and his effects were not
sufficiently prepared, but under his direction the brassiness was
kept down, and a proper balance maintained. There is genuine emotion
in his strains, significance in his melodies, characterization
of personages and forcible construction of scenes, though he did
not surpass "William Tell". He neglected concerted music and does
not include one separate regularly constructed piece. His solo melodies
are beautiful. His "Aida" is saturated with local color, Egyptian
music, with a masterly combination of strings, woodwind and
voice. "Il Trovatore" is not an opera but a set of detached pieces
held in loose contact on a string. There was little action and we
find page after page to be sung at the footlights with only mechanical
gestures. Verdi avoided the "leitmotiv", and relegated mere
tune to the background. In "Falstaff" there is a complete independence
of restrictive formalism that modern music drama requires to
illustrate the play, which enhances the significance of the situations.</p>

<h2 id="V_POST_WAGNERIAN_SCHOOL">V. POST WAGNERIAN SCHOOL&mdash;INCLUDING MODERN RUSSIAN,
FRENCH, ITALIAN, GERMAN, AND AMERICAN COMPOSERS.</h2>

<p>Michael Ivanovitch Glinka is called the "Father of Russian
Opera". He combined the technique, forms and counterpoint of
Italy and Germany with the Russian folksong and rythm. He was
choice of his subjects, and thought that the management of the
plots ought to be more simple, and the music in the style of natural
song. There is energy and also vitality in "La Vie pour le Tsar"
and "Russlau et Ludmille". In Russian folk songs we find the music
suitable to the words.</p>

<p>The Russian folk like acting and their customs in their
wedding ceremonies, etc., are an ideal basis for an opera school.
Glinka used the fierce struggle of the contending nations for a
background, and let the story be related and enacted by four central
figures. His realism surpassed the trivial impossibilities of the
Italian school. He did not combine involved themes in a pot-pourri
style so that none could be distinguished, but rather created
atmosphere. His instrumentalism is sonorous and uses five-four,
six-four and seven-four time.</p>

<p>The "Pique Dame" of Tschaikovsky has a style like that of
other composers beyond set forms of the older operas though not of
the music drama. The arias, duets, choruses and ballets are dramatically
appropriate, and the orchestra is more of a function than
an accompaniment. In "Boris Godonnow" there is no principle tenor
part, no principle contralto part and no principle soprano part.
If it is a singer's opera at all it is a basso's, but it really is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
more for chorus. The writing for solo declamatory passages occassioned
the use of the lyric passages in the orchestra, which was
made the purveyor of color. The atmosphere is not symphonic, though
the development is important and we find a remarkable use of the
leitmotiv but the composer never even heard of Wagner.</p>

<p>Nicolai Andreyevitch Rimski-Korsakov was a serious student
of Russian folk lore. His music is free and expressive&mdash;so much so
that when he studied technique seriously, it was almost impaired.
His operas are versatile, but his "Snow Maiden" is a trifle old-fashioned,
although he fails to express pathos, delicate tenderness
etc. The stage phantasmoriga, of "Christmas Eve or Vakoul the Smith",
especially at the transformation scenes is accompanied with music
wild and bizarre, yet consummate in its descriptive finesse. He was
dissatisfied with the foreign elements of the Italian form of opera
which Glinka and Tschaikovsky could assimilate to excellent purpose.
He cannot seem to decide whether opera is lyrical or symphonic. His orchestra
suggests the soft freshness of a May night atmosphere in the
steppes of Russia, the aroma of flowers, the enchanting long drawn
notes of a nightingale interspersed with the love element, and the
vocal characterization of the Mayor and the Bailiff in this "A
May Night" is extremely clever. Like Strauss, he uses certain themes
for certain instruments and has the Russian desire to mingle meaning
and sound.</p>

<p>Wagner laid down the theories but his imitators have failed
because they did not have his genius. Rimski-Korsakov is noted for
his brilliant orchestration and the ugly and cruel music leading
up to his situations, but he combines dignity and simplicity with
realism and not with the romantic. The protogonists of his drama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
are, the Russian people, and that is the reason for the extended
use of the chorus. There is no central situation, as the people
and one character, or sometimes two, make up the drama. It is easy
to omit or transpose a scene thus showing the loosenes of the dramatic
construction, which is a merit in a musical play, for the
composer can express the central ideas of the drama without being
bound hand and foot by dramatic situations. In the modern music
drama the orchestra expresses all that cannot be expressed by the
dramatic action and the singers. Rimski-Korsakov's is mainly a subjective
expression of composition, while Moussorgsky's orchestra
is never subjective, but always objective. Borodini's "Prince Igor"
is a colorful barbaric ballet while in Dargomysky's "The Water
Sprite", "The Stone Guest" there are interesting intermediary recitative
sections, although the recitative of "La Pskovitaine" is
dry.</p>

<p>Xaver Schwarwenka'a opera "Mataswinthe" resembles those
of Wagner of the "Lohengrin" period. They are thoroughly modern.
The muted horns in the orchestra give dramatic expressiveness in
harmony and the composer uses the free arioso style. There is not
the set form of the Italian school, but the modern declamatory
arioso, monologues and duets, discarding recitative, and introducing
massive ensembles with key complexity, but never smothering
them with the orchestra.</p>

<p>Balakirew and Borodini employ good airs, especially in the
ballet, and color their orchestra wonderfully. Cesar Cui used melodic
recitative with the interdiction of the repetitions of words,
and there is an absence of duets and trios and every piece of ensemble,
and every one affecting a definite and complete character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
"Angelo" and "The Filibuster" are too extreme, for the three acts
of recitaive become monotonous. This school's form is vague except
for the audacious harmonization.</p>

<p>Puccini adds to Wagner's reform, with the peculiar style
of modern French and Italian composers which alternates light and
varied orchestration and melody, with harsh, almost crude instrumentation.
He demonstrates that the orchestra may be made to interpret
shades and transitions of rapid and subtle emotion, and he produced
an actual musical diction with some of the finest passages
for the orchestra alone. His sense of melody is supreme in his
combination of Italian and German methods. His impressive manner
of intensifying and underscoring dramatic moments in the action
is unparalleled as is also his capacity for forceful and succinct
orchestral commentary. He uses his music to paint scenes and makes
continuous use of distinctive and rythmic melody and there is an
absence of any definite characterization by means of a leitmotiv,
for his work is lighter than that of Wagner's. He maintains that
opera must have local color, so therefore we find an interweaving
of American airs in his "Girl of the Golden West" and American
and Japanese airs in "Madame Butterfly". His score is genuinely
Puccinean and an influence of Debussy is betrayed in an harmonic
way.</p>

<p>The prelude to "Madame Butterfly" Is not an overture,
though it does state some motives. His songs constantly contain
one melody in the instrumental against the unrelated vocal part,
and he reflects the modern moods and ideas in a score intricate in
counterpoint, rich in embellishment, full of the melodic fluency
of the Italian temperament and strength of the German school. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Japanese effects give beautiful lyric movements but they are not
as great as Verdi's. There is intense dramatic vigor in "Manon
Lescaut" which has spoken dialogue with running orchestral accompaniment
and motives. "La Boheme" has neither overture nor intermezzo,
and lacks sustained melody. Puccini is termed the only one
with as much genius as Wagner, for he agrees that too much realism
is cramping to good music, and he proves that music drama can be
loosely constructed and need not conform to spoken drama standards.</p>

<p>Debussy, in "Pelleas and Melisande" places a statue on
a stage, not a musical one, but one of dramatic action and declamation.
The vocal parts are reduced to a minimum of musical expressiveness
and the music, a sort of rythmless chant, is subordinate
to action. He is about the only composer who makes music dependent
entirely on the drama. Wagner's orchestra is a bug driving force,
while Strauss' delicate shifting of the background of the polyphony
does not drown the voices. Debussy does not compose with the
aim of orchestral composition as do Wagner and Strauss. With Puccini,
Debussy and Charpentier, the human voice counts as a real medium.
In "Pelleas and Melisande" there is a tress on the naturalness of
the recitative. Debussy makes music the servant of the drama and
makes a symphonic use of motives which are not developed formally,
but manipulated in an undercurrent of musical thought. He declares
melody anti-dramatic, and in recitative with the orchestra there
is freedom for individual interpretation. His "L'Enfant Prodigue"
is composed along the regular lines and is his best work. He follows
Cesar Franck's method of scattering a number of disconnected
themes and leaving them to sort themselves.</p>

<p>In Dukas' "Ariane and Bluebeard", set melodies are avoided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and everything is in plastic style of music drama, with shimmering
tone color and a wealth of orchestral touches. Louis Aubert's
"The Blue Forest", is an effective combination of modernity and
simplicity with much use of leading motives and some fairly definite
numbers. "Les Heretiques" displays enervating voluptuousness
and languor in the duet. There are grave and large accents for the
invocation to Venus by Daphne. The orchestral lamentation at the
close is graceful and the choruses are charming, but the dialogue
is wearisome. He is a disciple of Massenet in his correct portrayal
of the suavity, sweetnes and fascination of women. In "Le Petite
Boheme" the orchestration is rich and effective and the dramatic
action is developed.</p>

<p>Franchetti's "Germania" is a lyric two act drama with a
prologue and an epilogue, aping Wagner, Verdi, Puccini and Tschaikovski.
Delibes, a new dramatist, uses unusual discretion in the
color expression of the orchestra but with very little acting. His
modulation scheme is rich and more melodic, but it is almost as
declamatory as that of Strauss. Saint Saens and Massenet are less
radical with a light melodic orchestra. Massenet's music in "Le
Jongleur" and "Griselidis" is not strong enough to atone for tiresome
episodes in the plot. The chorus plays an important but invisible
part, throughout.</p>

<p>The Charpentier orchestra and neither Strauss-like nor
Wagnerian. His "Louise" is constructed according to Wagner but creates
an atmosphere rather emphasizing themes. It has musical originality,
dramatic novelty and picturesque reproductions of life,
style, and a blend of romanticism and reality. He is influenced by
Massenet in musical speech and orchestral style. He emphasizes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
lyrical element by the use of melodic recitative rather than by
aria. He develops motives for descriptive importance with polyphonic
style. The individual sonority of the orchestra reduses the
stress on the orchestra's departure from the Wagnerian ideas. He
reduced the dependence of these ideas to a minimum, and asserted the
value of reliance on the native sources of music and drama.</p>

<p>Bruneau was a pupil of Massenet with undistinguished melodic
patterns. He followed Wagner in the close continuity of drama
and accurate characterization in music, fitting a characterization
for varying dramatic atmospheres. His "Kerim" displays militarism
and is a contrast to the pastoral elements in "L'Attaque
du Moulin". His thematic manipulation is not flexible enough but his
harmonic idiom is ingenuous and true to the qualities of race and
time. D'Albert's "Tiefland" has a prologue and two acts, and combines
the Wagner and Puccini swift and pliant orchestra, which colors
and intensifies, but dispenses with the elaboration of Wagner's
symphonic chorus. Chenier's "Liberia", strange to say, has
one strain repeated and repeated. Chabrier is noted for his delicate
expression and his fidelity and vigor of delineation. In "Briseis"
the fresh aroma of the sea is suggested by the soft singing of
the sailors without any overture or prelude. Bruneau in "Zola"
writes flexible music and has a capacity for unmetred prose used for
vocal purposes, a caustic rugged sincerity with an element of passion
and little tenderness. Charpentier's "Louise" has the quick
lithe movement of the Parisian character; gay, amused and amusing.</p>

<p>Richard Strauss uses a more complex orchestra than Wagner
and we find leading motives as in Wagner. He is one of the
most severely criticized composers of modern times. He has been
accused of outrageous infraction of every musical law. The mood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in "Electra" is implicit in the play, but it is reinforced by
Strauss' orchestration. Where Beethoven or Wagner entrances are
splendid, the instrumental equivalent of Strauss grates. He is typical
to the moods, etc., of the play. He uses discords to represent
a mad woman, but is musically beautiful in the recognition of brother
and sister and love. The chief characters are depicted by leading
motives, dissonance and orchestral bewilderments, and his power
of characterization is extraordinary. There are forty-five themes
in "Electra". He uses different instruments to represent the different
animals, etc. For instance, the grunting of the pigs is represented
by six bassoons and a flute.</p>

<p>There are one hundred and four musicians in "Salome",
with sixty strings and an organ celeste. Three men carry on an excited
conversation, one in seven eighth time, one in five eighth
time and one in four four time, while the orchestra continues its
original tempo.</p>

<p>Puccini, Humperdinck and Mascagni are considered by many
to be the best living composers. "Königskinder" is chiefly declamatory
and never sacrfices the human voice for the orchestra, and
expounds and illustrates, but never fails to support the shapely
arioso by rarely defined melody.</p>

<p>"Conchita" by Riccardo Zandonai embraces a few fragmentary
themes and the voice parts are declamatory without a melodic
line or the shapeliness of an arioso. Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana"
shows the introduction of a new device with the performance
of the orchestral interlude and division of the work into
two parts, with the curtain remaining up and showing the empty
stage. Both he and Leoncavello have written short operas with effective
librettos, and they stand for dramatic verities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Our American composers seem to follow different schools and styles
without establishing one of their own. "Mona" by Horatio Parker
assigns not a motive for a label to each character but a tonality,
though only one blessed with absolute pitch can appreciate this.
Walter Damrosch's "Cyrano" is in a post-Wagnerian style, a sort of
melodious arioso frequently broadening into definitely shaped airs,
with numerous ensembles, trios, quartets and choruses and the orchestra
plays an important part, being continuously melodious, but
not monopolizing melodic interest with leading motives attached to
characters. "The Pipe of Desire", by F. S. Converse, has passages in
a later Wagnerian style, and there are four prominent motives while
the orchestra is exceedingly good, especially in depicting the
"Naioa" theme. Victor Herbert's music is replete with local color
and drama, and the representative themes are not developed, although
his music is rather light and better suited for the operetta
and the salon.</p>

<p>Thus we see how the musical forms of the opera have changed
from the older more vocal feats to the newer well developed music
drama. Gluck and Wagner brought back the undying principles of dramatic
truth. In the days of Bellini, Rossini and Donizetti, melody
was supreme and the dramatic truth was lost sight of. In "William
Tell" and "Der Freischütz" there was a step onward, and with Wagner
we find a return to, or reform, of the first principles of true
dramatic art as applied to the opera by the Bardi coterie. Individualism
is the prevailing tendency and succes depends on the forcibleness
of the characters and the development of the leitmotiv.</p>

<p>In our consideration of the operas, from "Rappresentatione
di Anima" to "Madeleine" we find the number of characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
growing larger, the orchestra more complex and perhaps usurping more
time, the solo work increasing considerably, recitative increasing,
ensemble almost vanishing and chorus work reduced to a minmum. The
opera of the future will be a medium between Wagner and Strauss,
orchestral music drama, and the Debussy incidental music, and the
melodiousness of the Italian school. The most vital music dramas of
the day do not abandon nor drown out the voice, nor do they cast
aside all musical connections, but combine orchestra, voice and dramatic
action in an artistic way.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
